# Graduate Take Home Assignment Solution

I've setup using **Create React App** & design the frontend website 
with **ChakraUI**. 

When a user sign up to my app, **Auth0** behind the
scene will be executed, a user has two choices of signing up either
through social sign up (eg **GitHub**) or sign up with conventional method email & password.
After signing up, user profile data such as `email` & `name` will be fetched & 
displayed on the UI.

Feel free to run this in production by visiting https://graduate-take-home-assignment.vercel.app/.
