# { "developer": "Graduate Trainee" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically. You are free to implement in whatever language you are comfortable in. This challenge contains two questions out of which you are only required to attempt one. However, being able to do deliver two questions is an added advantage in your application :)

## Coding Challenge ()


### Question 1.
Design a frontend website or mobile application User Interface (UI) that has two three features: User Registration, Sign-On screen/module, and User Profile interface. The interface should implement a user journey as described: The registration, Sign-On, and then Profile interface. The user profile page should be neat and creative.

Requirements: 
- Frontend Application / UI only (React JS, Vue JS, or Angular JS)
- Dummy interface - zero connection with the backend

### Question 2. 
Implement a user registration and login API, connect mysql database, a user should be able to register and then use the registered detials to sign into the system. A signed in user should be able to log out from the system.

Requirements: 
- Backend Application (Node JS, Python, Golang e.t.c)
- Dummy interface - zero connection with the backend

### Notes and recommendations

- Use Node.js | Python
- The languages, frameworks and libraries mentioned are recommendations only, you are free to use whatever you are comfortable with.
- The project structure is up to your decision.
- You are recommended to use git commits in a logical manner to demonstrate the development progress
- Writing tests and adhering to development standards/conventions will attract extra points.

### The HandOver

- Send your implementation in Git Repo.

### The Review

Please include a README file with a quick description of your solution.

### Submission

- Email your work to careers@regovtech.com & techchallenge@regovtech.com
